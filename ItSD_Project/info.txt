###################################GAS SIM######################################

1.APP INFO

GAS SIM is simple animation app that simulates movement of ideal gas particles. 
There are also available thermodynamic processes simulations.
One interesting and additional feature is that
user is able to simulate movement of particles in other
gravity acceleration than 9.81 m/s^2.
User also has got possibility to view particle parameters:
- kinetic energy
- velocity
Using arrows user is capable to see parameters of each particle.

2. USER MANUAL

Control of a program is from console level. To move in menu user has to 
choose proper numbers' option and confirm choice by click on enter.
In case when entered number is out of range the proper information will
appear on the screen. 
In 'Sumulate!' bookmark are available thermodynamic processes and
gravity simulations.
Under app logo are shown first state parameters. When one option is selected
user is asked to enter parameters of the second system state.
After that the simulation will appear.
To exit simulation just clikc on red 'x' sign in the right upper corner.
Thus, the simulation can be repeated or the app work can be finished by choosing 
number 3 from main manu.
